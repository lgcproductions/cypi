# cypi

Cypi is a Raspbery Pi infused robot (Cybot). The robot, Cybot came from a 90's magazine called Real Robots where you built and programed a robot. Cypi is intended to be used to learn programming and how to interact with the outside world via sensors.

** Disclaimer **
Cypi is intended as a project for me to learn a whole host of new skils. From programming, electronics, sensors, and even using github and much more. Please take into consideration that there may be erros within the code and this tutorial.

There may be a better way of doing certain items in the code. Please do leave a comment. Thank you ^_^
